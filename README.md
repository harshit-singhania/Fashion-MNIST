# Fashion-MNIST

## About the project
This project uses the Fashion MNIST dataset which contains 70,000 grayscale images in 10 categories. The images show individual articles of clothing at low resolution (28 by 28 pixels) 

The Fashion MNIST dataset provides a good introduction to computer vision and deep neural networks.
