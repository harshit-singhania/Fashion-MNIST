# Fashion-MNIST

## About the project
This project uses the Fashion MNIST dataset which contains 70,000 grayscale images in 10 categories. The images show individual articles of clothing at low resolution (28 by 28 pixels) 

The Fashion MNIST dataset provides a good introduction to computer vision and deep neural networks. 

Fashion MNIST is intended as a drop-in replacement for the classic MNIST datasetâ€”often used as the "Hello, World" of machine learning programs for computer vision. The MNIST dataset contains images of handwritten digits (0, 1, 2, etc.) in a format identical to that of the articles of clothing you'll use here.

This project uses Fashion MNIST for variety, and because it's a slightly more challenging problem than regular MNIST. Both datasets are relatively small and are used to verify that an algorithm works as expected. They're good starting points to test and debug code.

Here, 60,000 images are used to train the network and 10,000 images to evaluate how accurately the network learned to classify images. We can directly import and load the MNIST dataset from TensorFlow.
